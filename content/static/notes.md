##Notes 
_[reload](#notes)_  
_notes on how my website is progressing, where it's been and why I chose the
direction I am currently headed_

###Post change to Ajax
I rewrote the website to use ajax because I thought it would be fun to know the
basics of how ajax works...  
also so I can stream music from my site, while
navigating it, uninterrupted.

###Content Structure
So far I have had no problems with using flatfiles, of course scaling would be
a bad idea!, but having looked at a couple of other easy to maintain
'blog-like' programs, Mine seems to run very quickly. I tried out another
content based site that used md parsing for the pages, but it took ages to load
a webpage.  
I'm going to have to complement the parser then as that must be doing a large
majority of the work.

###Page design
I have tried to keep the website nice and simple, I have split it into 6
pieces, 3 _body_ columns, the middle one is populated by content. The other two
are not being used at the moment, and I have no plans to use them at the
moment.  
I then have my footer split into 3 columns, spanning the same width as the
body, this should keep my footers aligned with my body if I ever want to do
anything fancy with the footers!  
I need to put in some basic text in the middle footer column, but have not
considered what to write/link to.  
the right column is reserved for useful buttons at the moment. one linking
home, the other linking to the top of the current document, (for if/when I
write something that is actually of a decent enough length!
