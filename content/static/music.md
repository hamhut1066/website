[Pretty Lights](http://prettylightsmusic.com) (they also use html5!)
<strike>this is an epic band, slightly grimy bass, but nothing too
hectic.</strike>
- I was a little rushed in saying this, considering I had only listened to
      one song, but they are an artist certainly worth investing time in.
From what I've heard so far, they have an interesting style that interests me.

Okay, I was a little harsh on saying there was grimy bass, there is a lot of
variation in what they do. Just finished listening to `A Color Map Of The Sun`
and it was very peaceful. I enjoyed it immensely.
