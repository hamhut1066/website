This is the backup/version control of my website.
It uses php, with a markdown parser so that I can easily manage the content of
my webpages

It uses a master page to ease the formatting of each page!. and has (hopefully)
separated out the separate logical parts of the website in a way that makes it
easy to maintain.

Installation
----
it should be completely self-contained, so if you have a php environment
installed, then just clone it and navigate to public/index.php, and you should
have a running system.


Todo
----

I aim to make it very easy to configure, so that you can easily change the
website to the needs of any site, just by editing the config file.
